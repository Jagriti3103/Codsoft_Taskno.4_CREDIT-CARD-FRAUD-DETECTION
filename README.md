# Codsoft_Taskno.4_CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

__**Overview:**__
_The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. A classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, is trained to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. Additionally, techniques like oversampling or undersampling may be employed to improve results._
