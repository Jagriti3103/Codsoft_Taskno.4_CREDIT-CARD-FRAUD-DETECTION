# Codsoft_Taskno.4_CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

__**Overview:**__
_The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. A classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, is trained to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance. Additionally, techniques like oversampling or undersampling may be employed to improve results._
